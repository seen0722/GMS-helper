**Estimated Duration:** 2 - 2.5 Minutes

---

## 🎬 Preparation Checklist
*   **Clean Browser:** Close unrelated tabs. Open the GMS-Helper Dashboard.
*   **Data Prep:** Have a "Demo Run" ready in the database with ~1000 failures (mix of Audio, Media, Permission issues) so the results look impressive.
*   **Resolution:** set screen resolution to 1920x1080 (1080p) for clarity.
*   **Mouse:** Use a smooth mouse movement, avoid jerky jumps.

## 📝 Script & Storyboard

| Time | Visual Scene (Screen Recording) | Voiceover (Script) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00** | **[Scene: Dashboard Home]**<br>Show the main dashboard with a clean, modern interface. Briefly hover over the "Recent Test Runs" list. | "Welcome to the GMS Intelligent Analysis System. This platform allows us to transform the tedious GMS certification process into an automated, data-driven workflow." |
| **0:15** | **[Scene: Upload/Select Run]**<br>Click on a test run labeled "**Certification_Run_Dec10**" (ensure it shows a high failure count, e.g., 850 failures). | "Here we have a typical certification run. As you can see, there are over 800 reported failures. Traditionally, our engineers would need days to triage these one by one." |
| **0:30** | **[Scene: Start AI Analysis]**<br>Click the **"Start AI Analysis"** button. Show a progress indicator (if available) or cut to the result appearing.<br>*(Speed up video if processing takes time)* | "With a single click, we engage our AI engine. The system first vectorizes the error logs and applies adaptive clustering to group similar issues." |
| **0:45** | **[Scene: Clustering Results]**<br>The screen updates to show the **Clusters View**. Instead of 800 lines, show ~15 cards/rows representing the clusters.<br>Highlight the dramatic reduction (850 -> 15). | "And in just seconds, those 800 failures are consolidated into just 15 unique problem clusters. We've effectively reduced the workload by 98%." |
| **1:00** | **[Scene: Deep Dive - Cluster 1]**<br>Click on a cluster named **"Media Codec Issues"**. Show the expanded view with the **AI Summary**, **Root Cause**, and **Solution** fields. | "Let's look closer at this 'Media Codec' cluster. The AI doesn't just group them; it analyzes the stack traces. Here, it correctly identifies that the MediaCodec wasn't initialized properly..." |
| **1:15** | **[Scene: Deep Dive - Actionable Advice]**<br>Highlight the "Suggested Solution" and "Assigned to: Media Team" text. | "...and creates a specific, technical solution for our developers. It even suggests assigning this directly to the Media Team." |
| **1:30** | **[Scene: Another Example]**<br>Quickly switch to a "Permission Issue" cluster. Show the XML manifest solution suggested by AI. | "Here is another example: a Security Exception. The AI instantly pinpoints the missing permission in the Android Manifest." |
| **1:45** | **[Scene: Report Generation]**<br>Click "**Export Report**" or show the "Trends" page showing failure rates going down over time. | "Finally, we can generate a comprehensive report for stakeholders instantly. We aren't just finding bugs faster; we are solving them faster." |
| **2:00** | **[Scene: Dashboard Home]**<br>Return to main screen. Fade to black with company logo or system name. | "This is the power of AI-assisted GMS Certification: Efficiency, Accuracy, and Speed. Thank you." |

## 💡 Tips for Recording
1.  **Zoom In:** Ensure text is readable. Zoom to 110% or 125% in the browser if needed.
2.  **Pause:** After clicking a button, wait 1 second before moving the mouse again. This makes editing easier.
3.  **High-Light:** If your recording software allows, add a subtle highlight around the mouse cursor.
